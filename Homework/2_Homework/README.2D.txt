For this assignment I implemented all the functions required. The big five, and several overloaded functions. These overloaded functions are custom functions that allow more functionality to our original purpose. They are adding, the [] operator, and the << operator. 
For the addition operator I simply used 3 loops. These loops appropriately accounted for all edge cases of the input's sequence size. 
The logic is explained in comments in the source code. The << operator simply adds objects to the output stream and returns it.
Again, the explaination is all provided in comments in the source code.
