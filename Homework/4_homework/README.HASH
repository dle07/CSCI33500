These are the following sources I used to help me complete this assignment
Most of the functions I've written were simply based off the starter code given to us and modified.

1) For this assignment I completed all the parts. The whole assignment was completed
2) Some bugs I've encounted was segmentation faults which resulted in not appropriately modding the hash value by the table size.
   Another bug was not being able to modify class variables due to const restrictions applied to functions. To go around this I either included the keyword mutable or removed the const entirely

3)To run this program, download all files. Make sure you're on linux and run the following commands
In the console type make clean
Then run make all
Then choose which table you want to test against which files using the following templates below.

./create_and_test_hash <words file name> <query words file name> <flag>

./create_and_test_hash words.txt query_words.txt quadratic

./create_and_test_hash words.txt query_words.txt double R

//For spell checker...
./spell_check <document file> <dictionary file>

4)Input files are all .txt files, they're dictionary files and document files that contain query words.
Ex: document1.txt, query_words.txt, words.txt, wordsEnglish.txt

There are no output files..
